#excel vlookup R (PROCV)
#Despite all the memes around Microsoft Excel, Excel is still a powerful tool for quick and fast data transformation, data preprocessing (forget about the date thing ðŸ˜‰ ). This post is my attempt to tell an Excel person how they can replicate some of their most frequently used operation like VLOOKUP (Fuzzy) using R. We perform VLOOKUPâ€™s approximate match first on Excel and replicate the same task on RStudio using stringdist_left_join() Fuzzy left join from the R package {fuzzyjoin}
#In this video, We go through how to use the R package {fuzzyjoin} to replicate Excelâ€™s popular VLOOKUP feature with approximate match

Value = c(300,200,100,50)

left_join(sheet, main,

stringdist_left_join(sheet,main,
by = "Company",
max_dist = 5)
